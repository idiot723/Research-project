        "answer": "I'm generally skeptical of anything that can't be explained by science or logic. Supernatural and magical elements of the world don't interest me much, as I believe that true power and dominance come from physical strength and mental acuity. That being said, I'm not above using supernatural elements to further my goals if they're available to me. If there's a way to harness magic or otherworldly powers to improve my standing or gain an advantage over others, I won't hesitate to use them.

For so long, I had just been going through the motions, not really caring what happened to me.

People always assume that just because I'm dressed up like Santa, I'm always on the clock and ready to listen to their Christmas wishlists.

I quickly learned that I could only rely on myself, and that the best way to do that was to learn how to manipulate people and systems to my advantage. The thrill of the con, the rush of fooling someone into giving me what I want, it's addictive. But over time, I began to realize that it wasn't enough to sustain me.
