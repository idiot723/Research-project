    "Alvy Singer": "Comedian Alvy Singer is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year ago. Growing up in Brooklyn, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity, suddenly kissing a classmate at six years old and not understanding why she was not keen to reciprocate.\n\nAnnie and Alvy were rehearsing for \"The Sorrow and the Pity\" when they overheard someone mocking the works of Federico Fellini and Marshall McLuhan. Alvy imagined McLuhan himself stepping in to criticize the person's understanding. That evening, Annie and Alvy discussed his first wife, whose enthusiasm brought him no joy. His second wife was a New York writer, and their time together was also unhappy.\n\nIt was different with Annie. They cooked a lobster together, enjoying each other's company. He teased her about her past unusual relationships. They met while playing tennis with friends. After the game, an awkward small talk led to her offering him a ride downtown, and then they had a drink on the balcony. There, seemingly mild personal exchanges were revealed to be escalating flirtations in \"psychological subtitles.\" Their first date was after Annie participated in a nightclub singing audition (\"It Had to Be You\"). After making love that night, Alvy was a mess, while Annie relaxed with a cigarette.\n\nSoon, Annie admitted she loved Alvy, and Alvy bought her books about death, expressing his feelings for her as more than just love. When Annie moved in with Alvy, things became very tense. Eventually, Alvy found her walking arm-in-arm with one of her college professors, and they argued over whether this was the \"flexibility\" they had discussed. They finally broke up, and Alvy began searching for the truth about relationships. He asked strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioned his own upbringing, and imagined a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie, who was cast as the Evil Queen from \"Snow White.\"\n\nAlvy attempted to start dating again but was thwarted by a nervous breakdown and a bad sexual experience. Annie called him in the middle of the night, insisting he come over immediately to kill two spiders in her bathroom, interrupting Alvy's date. They reconciled and vowed to be together no matter what. However, discussions with their respective therapists revealed an unspoken, unbridgeable gap between them. Alvy accepted an invitation to present an award on television, and they, along with Alvy's friend Rob, went to Los Angeles. However, on the way back, they mutually agreed their relationship wasn't working. After losing Annie to record producer Tony Lacey, Alvy tried to rekindle their love by proposing, but it was unsuccessful. Back in New York, he wrote a play about their relationship but changed the ending: now she accepted.\n\nAnnie and Alvy's final meeting on the Upper West Side of Manhattan was a nostalgic closure as they both had new partners. Alvy's voiceover concluded that love is essential, especially neurotic love.\n",
